                  <p>Sam was a very personal young man, with a clear
                  passion for mechanical engineering. I was impressed
                  with his people skills and he scored well in the team
                  events. I wish Sam good luck with his future career.<br><br>

                  Sam was a great sport with a fun attitude and isnâ€™t
                  afraid to speak up. He is able to think through issues and
                  to focus on the task. I know that Sam will do well in the
                  engineering world.<br><br>
