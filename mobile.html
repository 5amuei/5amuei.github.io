                <p>When I was developing my formula team’s front and rear wings, I ran over 800 hours of CFD simulations.  The first 200 hours were the hardest, after many failed mesh attempts and invalid results, I had finally got the hang of it.  It was our teams first attempt at wings and I wanted to mitigate as much risk as possible. I chose an airfoil that was proven successful and used by many teams to make our molds because we would have to use them for at least five more years.  I learned a lot from the hours of CFD.  In this simulation I learned two things, it was important to include the driver, and the front wing need to be adjusted to move more air away from the tires.</p>

As the mechanical project lead, for three months I planned the equipment modifications that we had four days to perform and have code inspectors sign off on. I developed designs that could be installed quickly in the field with minimal tools that operated at the level of the existing equipment. I quoted and sourced or fabricated the parts I designed. I then lead a team of engineers and technicians to complete the project and pass down the lessons learned.</p>

Thanks to weeks of planning the build, and advice from my electrical engineering father, the conduit and wiring work went smoothly. By the time of this picture I had wired eight outlets, five lights with switches, and connections for either a generator or shore power into our breaker box.  I accounted for an additional four outlets and two lights, this early into a project I knew plans were bound to change. While I knew the conduit was a good idea for the thin walls I would be putting screws into I did learn life would have been easier had I gone with a large size.</p>

            <p class="text">Insulation was one of the most difficult decisions of our build.  After many calculations of R values and energy use I still wish we had done a few things different.  We based our decision on the type and amount of insulation on the heating and cooling, sound dampening, environmental impact, and ease of installation. With all those considerations we picked a loose particle insulation made from recycled clothes. We failed to account for how that would make the thin panels we used for walls bulge.  At least it was quiet and stayed cool during the Texas summers until noon.</p>

            <p class="text">It really started to feel like a home once we got some paint on the walls. We got a great deal on a sliding glass door and that helped open up the space.  At night or when we went out we pulled down the trucks over head door and secured it with a bluetooth dead bolt lock.</p>

            <p class="text">The frame of the box made it easy to put in our kitchen cabinets, one of the main reasons I pushed my fiancee for a box truck instead of a school bus.  We also used the truck's flat roof for enough solar panels to charge a few devices, power LED lights, and charge four deep cycle marine batteries to get us through the night.  We still needed a generator to run the air conditioner and water heater. I wired the electrical system to switch between solar and a generator we kept in an external enclosure. We purchased a realible exhaust piping system to route it as far away as possible. We also put in four carbon monoxide alarms, better safe than sorry.</p>

            <p class="text">With a cool well lit work space we set to the kitchen.  The mini fridge in the cabinets was one of the most difficult items to size our battery bank for but we were glad to have it.  During the framing of the bathroom we put in pipes for the shower and ran the rest of the plumbing system under the truck.  The plumbing is like many traditional RVs with three tanks and a pump.  </p>

            <p class="text">The shower hands down took the longest due to my inexperience.  Over two months I built this shower four times before I was happy with the outcome. When it was finished we could take the tiny house camping off grid and enjoy a continuous ten minute hot shower before the water heater couldn't keep up. With the pull cord shut off valve there was enough hot water for both my fiancee and me.</p>

            <p class="text">In total we spent $18,000 over 185 days to build our box truck tiny home. We stayed in the tiny house for 18 months moving from California to Texas, Texas to Florida, and finally back to Texas.  The tiny house is now maintained by my uncle as an AirBnB. In the end we saved about $2,000 on rent, learned many lessons, and have a great story to tell.</p>
